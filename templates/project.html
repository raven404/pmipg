The concern for the well-being of the Nandlal slum kids is what began the incredible undertaking. Over a year ago it was observed
                                    that a leading cause of sickness among the kids is malnutrition. The most plausible and practical solution was vitamins! With a goal before us, the plan was set in motion. In the time since, PMI’s founder, Dr. Peter
                                    Malakar, met with a trusted friend who directed him to just the right source.</div>

Internships are not summer jobs, but rather, academic requirements for serious
                                        students. It is a learning experience primarily, not a money making opportunity. And second, do you have the desire to serve and learn? If you can answer yes to both, then PMI may be a promising prospect. In fact,
                                        we see it as a once-in-a-lifetime chance to find more than just a passing mark. Find a purpose. Find a course to set your eyes on. Contact us when you’re ready!</div>

                                        but we all have to face death. Everything in between, what we call life, only continues this trend. One different “sameness” we’d like you to consider is how every person is uniquely gifted. Some have athleticism,
                                        others excel in learning, some in art or music, and the list goes on - but the sameness is profound: we are all abled! That is why at PMI we refuse to comply with the phrase “disabled” - it doesn’t fit our anthropology!
                                        Individuals that are blind, deaf, mute, paraplegic without limbs, and so forth are wonderfully “differently-abled” - abled in a way that rest of us aren’t!</div>
